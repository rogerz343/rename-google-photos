google photos todo

CODING

- make sure this can't happen: x_1.mp4 and x_1.jpg both exist
- check timezone metadata
  - default to US/Eastern if before 7/22/2019
  - default to US/Central if on or after 7/22/2019
- figure out edits made within google photos (original vs edited)

TESTING

- videos seem brOken? make sure they work
- investigate (20171109_222734_1.png, 20171109_222734_1.jpg)
- investigate 20180114_233930_1.jpg definitely not correct time (not using google time?)
- investigate 20181127: night sight version missing
- investigate lle photos 20190303_164910_1.png

> most problems prob come from rule in program "if date is more than X off, then
  the google photos date is prob correct"
